Convoy's game of life javascript implementation

The program uses a swap between two arrays instead of a popular map implementation, where a lot of new arrays are generated. 
That is why this code is much more efficient and can handle bigger GOL universes.
The game is perfomed on a Torroidal Array, means the array is "glued" on opposite sides together.
